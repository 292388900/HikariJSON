HikariJSON
==========

A High-performance JSON parser.

HikariJSON is targeted exclusively at Java 8.  If you need legacy support, there are several decent libraries available.

----------------------------------------------------
***JMH Benchmarks***<br/>
Microbenchmarks were created to isolate and measure the overhead of popular JSON libraries using the [JMH microbenchmark framework](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) developed by the Oracle JVM performance team. You can checkout the [HikariJSON benchmark project for details](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariJSON-benchmark) and review/run the benchmarks yourself.
